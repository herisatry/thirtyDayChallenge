The foreach() method, at first returned a length of 0, i spend few days trying to figure out what was the problem. eventually came accross the answer i needed by googling. 
As a note to myself and those reading this, as a best practice, always load the <script></script> at the end of the body tag, especially when you decide to play with DOM element, it lets the page load first all the DOM an then you can manipulate as you which.

I will so add this minor correction to the html files from challenges : 
    - DRUMKITJS
    - CSS VARIABLE
    
The tricky use of filter(), map() , sort() , reduce(), include(),
ternary condition [ condition1 ? true : false ]
